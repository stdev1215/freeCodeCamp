              Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw
              how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."

              to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to
              school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding
              pest-resistent plants.

              attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to

              and other applied science.

              his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant
              pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000
              different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different
              varieties for each major climate on Earth.

              high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds well
              to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
